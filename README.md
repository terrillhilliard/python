# remotekeylogger
Welcome to the remote keylogger with Python3 project! This tool allows users to remotely track keystrokes on a target computer.

Please note that the use of keyloggers can be unethical and may be illegal in some cases. This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that they are using the tool in a legal and ethical manner.

The keylogger is written in Python3 and utilizes a range of libraries and modules to function. It is designed to run in the background, silently recording keystrokes and sending them to a specified remote server. The server can then be accessed by the user to view the recorded keystrokes.

This project is a work in progress and is constantly being updated and improved. If you have any suggestions or contributions, we welcome your input. Thank you for considering this project.
